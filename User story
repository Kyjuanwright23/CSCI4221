As a college student, I want to create an app that can help plan my courses semester by semester so that I can graduate on time and stay on track with my degree requirements.

Description:

The GradPlan app will allow students to create a personalized academic plan by selecting courses for each semester. The system will automatically check degree requirements and alert students if they’re missing prerequisites or taking too many/few credits. Students can view their progress toward graduation as a percentage or GPA estimate.

Acceptance Criteria:
 The student can log in or sign up using their college email.
 The student can add, edit, and delete courses from their semester plan.
 The app automatically checks degree requirements (e.g., major core classes, electives).
 The system provides a progress bar showing percentage completion toward graduation.
 The student can save their plan to the cloud and access it from any device.
 The student receives notifications or alerts for schedule conflicts or missing requirements.
 Advisors can view or suggest changes (optional future feature).
